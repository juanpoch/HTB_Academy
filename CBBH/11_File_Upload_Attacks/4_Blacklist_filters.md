# Blacklist Filters

Try to find an extension that is not blacklisted and can execute `PHP` code on the web server, and use it to read `/flag.txt`.

`Hint`: When you fuzz for allowed extensions, change the content to a PHP 'hello world' script. 
Then, when you you check the uploaded file, you would know whether it can execute PHP code.
