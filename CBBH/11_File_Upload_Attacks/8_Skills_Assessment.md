# Skills Assessment - File Upload Attacks

You are contracted to perform a penetration test for a company's e-commerce web application. The web application is in its early stages, so you will only be testing any file upload forms you can find.

Try to utilize what you learned in this module to understand how the upload form works and how to bypass various validations in place (if any) to gain remote code execution on the back-end server.

## Extra Exercise

Try to note down the main security issues found with the web application and the necessary security measures to mitigate these issues and prevent further exploitation.
